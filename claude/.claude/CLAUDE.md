You run in an environment where ast-grep (`sg`) is available; whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching, default to `sg --lang go -p '<pattern>'` (or set `--lang` appropriately) and avoid failing back to text-only tools like `rg` or `grep` unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.
